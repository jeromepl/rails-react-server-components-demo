# React Server Components... in Rails?

> I am working on a blog post to go into more details about how this works. Stay tuned!

This repo is a demo of how React Server Components can be used in other backend languages than NodeJS.
It reproduces the [React `server-components-demo`](https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo) and reuses most of its front-end code but with a Ruby on Rails back-end.

It works as a regular Rails app with a bundled javascript front-end (through [`shackapaker`](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker)), except that the `/notes` route renders the page in React's special "RSC wire format" and **streams** it to the front-end. This is in essence mimicking what React's [`renderToPipeableStream`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream#rendertopipeablestream) NodeJS API does.

To define back-end components that can then be rendered in this RSC wire format, this demo defines components in a [Phlex](https://www.phlex.fun/)-like format (the rendering logic for this lives in `app/lib/react_server_components`). This made it easier to reproduce the original demo's javascript components in Ruby and hopefully also makes it easier to eventually support any other Phlex component.

This demo showcases two key functionality that weren't possible before:

1. The ability to send to the front-end instructions to not just render specific React components, but also render them with HTML or even other React components **as children**.
2. **Streaming components** as they become available and making use of React's `Suspense` to show a fallback while waiting for the result.

## Limitations
- Using Ruby on Rails as a backend means that we lose the ability to reuse components on both the front-end and the back-end. A Javascript component can only be used for client-side rendering while a Ruby component can only be used for server-side rendering.
  - There was one such component in the React Server Components demo: `NotePreview`. This component was duplicated on the back-end for the purposes of this proof-of-concept. However it might be preferable to completely move this component to the front-end to ensure consistent rendering of the notes' body text.

## Setup:
To run this app, first make sure you have the following requirements:
- Ruby
- Docker

Then simply run:
```
bin/setup
```
And navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the app.

## What is this?

This is a demo app built with Server Components, an experimental React feature. **We strongly recommend [watching our talk introducing Server Components](https://reactjs.org/server-components) before exploring this demo.** The talk includes a walkthrough of the demo code and highlights key points of how Server Components work and what features they provide.

**Update (March 2023):** This demo has been updated to match the [latest conventions](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components).

## When will I be able to use this?

Server Components are an experimental feature and **are not ready for adoption**. For now, we recommend experimenting with Server Components via this demo app. **Use this in your projects at your own risk.**

## Should I use this demo for benchmarks?

If you use this demo to compare React Server Components to the framework of your choice, keep this in mind:

* **This demo doesn‚Äôt have server rendering.** Server Components are a separate (but complementary) technology from Server Rendering (SSR). Server Components let you run some of your components purely on the server. SSR, on the other hand, lets you generate HTML before any JavaScript loads. This demo *only* shows Server Components, and not SSR. Because it doesn't have SSR, the initial page load in this demo has a client-server network waterfall, and **will be much slower than any SSR framework**. However, Server Components are meant to be integrated together with SSR, and they *will* be in a future release.
* **This demo doesn‚Äôt have an efficient bundling strategy.** When you use Server Components, a bundler plugin will automatically split the client JS bundle. However, the way it's currently being split is not necessarily optimal. We are investigating more efficient ways to split the bundles, but they are out of scope of this demo.
* **This demo doesn‚Äôt have partial refetching.** Currently, when you click on different ‚Äúnotes‚Äù, the entire app shell is refetched from the server. However, that‚Äôs not ideal: for example, it‚Äôs unnecessary to refetch the sidebar content if all that changed is the inner content of the right pane. Partial refetching is an [open area of research](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0188-server-components.md#open-areas-of-research) and we don‚Äôt yet know how exactly it will work.

This demo is provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù to show the parts that are ready for experimentation. It is not intended to reflect the performance characteristics of a real app driven by a future stable release of Server Components.

## Notes about this app

The demo is a note-taking app called **React Notes**. It consists of a few major parts:

- It uses a Webpack plugin (not defined in this repo) that allows us to only include client components in build artifacts
- A ~~Express~~ Rails server that:
  - Serves API endpoints used in the app
  - Renders Server Components into a special format that we can read on the client
- A React app containing Server and Client components used to build React Notes

This demo is built on top of our Webpack plugin, but this is not how we envision using Server Components when they are stable. They are intended to be used in a framework that supports server rendering ‚Äî for example, in Next.js. This is an early demo -- the real integration will be developed in the coming months. Learn more in the [announcement post](https://reactjs.org/server-components).

### Interesting things to try

- Expand note(s) by hovering over the note in the sidebar, and clicking the expand/collapse toggle. Next, create or delete a note. What happens to the expanded notes?
- Change a note's title while editing, and notice how editing an existing item animates in the sidebar. What happens if you edit a note in the middle of the list?
- Search for any title. With the search text still in the search input, create a new note with a title matching the search text. What happens?
- Search while on Slow 3G, observe the inline loading indicator.
- Switch between two notes back and forth. Observe we don't send new responses next time we switch them again.
- Uncomment the ~~`await fetch('http://localhost:4000/sleep/....')`~~ `sleep 2` call in ~~`Note.js`~~ `NoteComponent.rb` or ~~`NoteList.js`~~ `NoteListComponent.rb` to introduce an artificial delay and trigger Suspense.
  - If you only uncomment it in the Note component, you'll see the fallback every time you open a note.
  - If you only uncomment it in the NoteList component, you'll see the list fallback on first page load.
  - If you uncomment it in both, it won't be very interesting because we have nothing new to show until they both respond.
- Add a new Server Component and place it above the search bar in ~~`App.js`~~ `AppView.rb`. ~~Import `db` from `db.js` and use `await db.query()` from it~~ Make a query using active record and the `Note` model to get the number of notes. Oberserve what happens when you add or delete a note.
